                <p>Bats are the only known mammals capable of flight. With over 1,000 species of bats, the Lesser Long-Nosed Bat (Leptonycteris Yerbabuenae) is one of the most important bat species in the world. This is due to the fact that this species is responsible for pollination in North and Central America. This species was on the endangered species list, but in recent years their population has made a stunning recovery and they are no longer considered endangered. </p>

             The lesser long-nosed bat is one of the smaller bat species. On average, the body of these bats are only 2.5 to 3.5 inches long and weigh in at about 0.5 to 0.9 ounces. Their coat colors range from a pale brown to gray color. They get their name from their elongated snout which has a triangular leaf shaped nose on the tip. This species also has a rather long tongue for a bat averaging at about 3 inches long which makes it easier to feed on flowering plants. It is also capable of flying up to 14 miles per hour.

             Bats are endothermic creatures meaning they maintain their own body temperature. Like most mammals, they also have bilateral symmetry. However, they stand out from other mammals due to their ability to fly. This is do to the adaptation of their elongated, webbed fingers. The lesser long-nosed bat has an average wingspan of 10 inches. They also have a rather short tail compared to other species of bats due to the fact that they only have three vertebrae in their tail. The lesser long-nosed bat has an average lifespan of roughly 12 years.

                    The lesser long-nosed bat is native to parts of Central and Northern Mexico as well as parts of Texas and New Mexico in the United States. During they day, they can be found in cave systems, and at night they search in desert scrub for food. They are one of the only known migratory species of bats. They migrate between Northern and Southern roosts so they can follow flowering plant activity and hibernate in the winter. Unfortunately, human development has led to the slow decline of their population as well as disruption of their maternity colonies and other habitat loss.

                This species of bat is very sociable. They migrate north each year to form maternity colonies. The female bat gives birth to one pup each year after a gestation period of about 6 months. They will then raise their young for about 5 months until the pup can fly. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Their natural predators are owls, snakes, and bobcats; however, humans have contributed to a significant number of deaths in the species due to hunting and trapping. The lesser long-nosed bat does not carry disease, but they are commonly mistaken for the vampire bat which does carry disease. This has also contributed to humans killing them off. Another factor contributing to decline in bat species is White-nose syndrome, an invasive fungus that is fatal.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unlike most species of bat, the lesser long-nosed bat feeds off of nectar and pollen. The flowers and fruits of plants such as the agave plant and saguaro cactus are the main staple of their diet. Thus, these bats have a very important relationship with humans serving as pollinators.
